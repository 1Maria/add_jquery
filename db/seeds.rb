    %{Even if you don't realize it, databases are everywhere, and they come in many
flavors.  They're not just in the obvious places like Facebook and Twitter;
you also have hundreds installed on the phone in your hand, and chances are
that your life would be easier if you'd built a few for yourself.  This course
will introduce you to basic database concepts, give you experience using them
for real-world applications, and demonstrate how one size most certainly does
not fit all.

Topics will include:

* Relational databases
* SQL wizardry
* Database design
* Object-relational mappings (specifically, ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails)
* Scalability and concurrency concerns
* NoSQL systems such as MongoDB and HBase

Given that relational databases currently rule the roost, the course
will be weighted towards the first three items on this list, but our
discussions will be in the context of the entire ecosystem from day one.},
  materials:
    %{* Laptop capable of running an Ubuntu Virtual Box.
      * Lots and lots of Internet.
      * No textbook is required for this course, although if you are interested in
        having a good reference to keep around after the class, I'd suggest the
        Pragmatic Programmer's [7 Databases in 7 Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks)
        by Eric Redmond and Jim R. Wilson.},
  objectives:
    %{* TODO
      *	Goals: the broad statements about what the students will gain from the course—knowledge, skills, attitudes, etc.
      *	Objectives: more specific statements (each related to a particular goal) about something assessable and measureable that students should be able to do by the end of the course (use specific verbs, such as describe, define, identify, explain, compare, contrast, evaluate, list, write, apply, solve, argue, support, construct, synthesize, articulate, differentiate, design, build, publish, post, integrate, interpret, relate, locate, map, trace, assess, etc.)
      *	Goals and Objectives should be written in terms of what students will do and how they will demonstrate what they have learned.}
