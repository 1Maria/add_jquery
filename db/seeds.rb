    %{Even if you don't realize it, databases are everywhere, and they come in
many flavors.  They're not just in the obvious places like Facebook and Twitter;
you also have hundreds installed on the phone in your hand, and chances are
that your life would be easier if you'd built a few for yourself.  This course
will introduce you to database concepts, give you experience using them
for real-world applications, and demonstrate how one size most certainly does
not fit all.

Approximately 60% of the course will be devoted to relational databases and DB
design.  The remaining 40% will cover NoSQL options such as MongoDB and Riak.}

    %{Course Objectives:

* Learn the fundamentals of database design.
* Understand the differences between relational, document, key-value, columnar, and graph databases.
* Appreciate the deep theoretical underpinnings of modern databases.
* Learn about current implementations of database types and their acceptance levels in industry.
* Communicate with others about real-world modeling using standard language.
* Appreciate the role that databases play in all levels of technology.
* Equip students with a series of tools which they can use in future endeavors to:
 * save time
 * retain knowledge or information that they discover/invent, and
 * think more critically about problems which they encounter in everyday life.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* Design a data structure to model real-world objects and information (CS Goal 1.d.)
* Select the appropriate database paradigm for various real-world situations (CS Goal 1.f.)
* Build SQL statements to create, modify, and read from relational databases (CS Goal 1.e.)
* Configure databases responsibly through transactions and indexing (CS Goal 1.d.)
* Work together to control relational databases through the Ruby on Rails framework (CS Goal 3)
* Balance theoretical and practical trade-offs such as consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CS Goal 1.e.)
* Apply a few advanced techniques for allowing databases to scale to millions of users (CS Goal 1.f.)

the class begins. The question will be removed at that time, so no partial
credit will be given for late submissions.

You will also be asked to "grade" each lesson. I will give out slips of paper
during each class (unless you all consistently bring your laptops, then we'll
do it online), and you will (a) consider how well you understood the material,
(b) rate it between 0 and 10 (10 meaning perfect clarity, 0 meaning you would have
learned more by sleeping), and (c) turn it in at the end of class.

    %{Each week (except for the midterm week and the project week), a set of
exercises will be due at the beginning of class on the last class day of the

students MUST write up solutions independently and list those with whom
they worked.

The Internet is a welcome (and obvious) resource for assisting you with your
assignments, although for a few problems, I may explicitly ask you not to
look.  Somtimes beating your head against a problem has learning value.
However should you happen to find an exact solution to one of the questions
while surfing the webz, then don't copy it. Hopefully I've gotten creative
enough to avoid that, and I know I shouldn't have to say it.  See the
"Academic Honesty" policy.

If you have an excused absence on the day an assignment is due, you will
be allowed to turn in your assignment 24 hours after your return without
penalty.  Unexcused absences will not extend the due date.  For every day

If you know that you will have an excused absence on the day of a
scheduled test, please make arrangements to take the test
prior to your absence.  If you miss a test due to an unexcused
absence, you will receive a zero on that test.

If, across all of your classes, you have more than 2 major assignments due
on the same day (and one of them is in this class), please let me know and
contact Academic Programs at least 48 hours in advance.}
